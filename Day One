Day One

I have found this awesome site called exercism, it is like duolingo for learning computer languages. 
It's still in the process of full development but I tried the Bash section, where the lessons are more like practice problems than point by point lessons.
So far so good! 

I've collected a few resources to help me get started, and this website really helps clarify my goals into tangible bite sized pieces.
My problem up to now has been wondering how in the world to get the structure to begin, so here we are! 

I'm sharing the link here in case anyone else sees this and wants to try it too. 

Good Luck everybody :)
