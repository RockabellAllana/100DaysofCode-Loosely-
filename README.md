# 100DaysofCode-Loosely-
Tracking progress as I attempt to learn to code! 


I am extremely new to coding, and aspire to become a well-rounded software engineer. I am creating this simple repository to monitor my own growth and progress.
While traditionally these days are done consecutively, I am a mother of two small kids, so I am challenging myself to do 100 days as soon as I can squeeze in time.
Feel free to message me or suggest simple projects and challenges you think may prove impactful.

If you are reading this, and following me on my ~journey~ Thank you! 

Happy New Year <3
